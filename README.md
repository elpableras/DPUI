Design and Programming of User Interfaces

Application JEE

JSP
- I have implemented all the HTML pages in JSP with the help of Tags, a technology that allows you to combine static HTML with dynamically generated code in the same file.

HTTP Basic Authentication
- When the browser requests a resource (jsp, for example), the server requests, username and password, traveling encrypted in base 64 encoding, very little secure and very simple.

Internationality: i18n
- The page detected in the browser by the user location, if the language is Spanish or English, and presents the page in that language. For the translation I have used the files "properties", on each language, where are all the texts of the Web site.

HttpFilter
- Intercept the invocation of the servlet BEFORE it is invoked servlet itself. I used for access control of authenticated users, because examine and modify the request before it reaches the servlet and also modify the response and redirect.
